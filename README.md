# TextasticExtensions
Custom written extensions for Textastic.

# Installation
As per the [documentation](https://github.com/blach/Textastic-Customization) these go into the `#Textastic/` directory. Code completions go into `#Textastic/CodeCompletions` and templates go into `#Textastic/Templates`.

# Use
Most of these are designed for use on the developer's personal projects, see [Stats For Sharks](https://www.statsforsharks) or [The Unified Republic of Stars](https://unifiedrepublicofstars.com). However, they can be easily modified for other projects/uses.
